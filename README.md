Coursera, Machine Learning with Python, Project, Loan case


The dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.
Based on this dataset I had to make a machine learning model using algorithms; K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression for predicting loan defaulters in future.
